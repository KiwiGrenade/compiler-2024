## Project compilation
### Necessary programs
It's recommended to build the project with the same or newer program versions than the ones listed belowe.
+ Bison -       3.8.2
+ Flex -        2.6.4
+ g++ -         11.4.0
+ GNU Make -    4.3

### Building the compiler
>\$ cd my_compiler/\
>\$ make

After building the project, you will get a binary file called **compiler**.

### Compiler usage

>$ ./compiler [OPTION] [INPUT_FILE] [OUTPUT_FILE]

#### Options:

    -v      verbose - will write all info/logs to standard output.

**ATTENTION!**
Always remember to grant execution rights to the binary file (**compiler**). How it's done on **LINUX**: 

>$ chmod u+x [FILE_NAME]

### Cleaning

Clean all build files:
>$ make clean-all

## Files
+ **grammar.y**, **lexer.lex** - definitions of lexical analyser and parser. Includes: grammar, keywords and functions from other files.

+ **grammar.cpp**, **grammar.hpp**, **lexer.cpp** - precompiled versions of files listed above. Generated by parser and lexer.

+ **CodeBlock.hpp**, **AST.hpp**, **AST.cpp** - headers and sources of various compiler elements. **CodeBlock.hpp** includes the definition of a code block and structures/elements used. **AST.hpp** and **AST.cpp** - define structures and classes used for construction of AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) and translation of tree nodes to pseudo assembler code.

+ **handlers.hpp**, **handlers.cpp** - definitions and declarations of functions responsible for handling the construction of an AST and semantic checks (variable initialization etc.).

+ **definitions.hpp** - macros and definitions used by multiple files.

+ **types.hpp** - mixed definition of an AST and a code block

+ **main.cpp** - definition and declaration of main, error and warning functions. Defines in what order the code compilation is done.
